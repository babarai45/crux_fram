# Android

When we use Crux to build Android apps, the Core API bindings are generated in
Java using Mozilla's [Uniffi](https://mozilla.github.io/uniffi-rs/).

The shared core (that contains our app's behavior) is compiled to a dynamic
library, using Mozilla's
[Rust gradle plugin](https://github.com/mozilla/rust-android-gradle) for Android
and the [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk). The library is loaded
at runtime using
[Java Native Access](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna).

The shared types are generated by Crux as Java packages, which we can add to our
Android project using `sourceSets`. The Java code to serialize and deserialize
these types across the boundary is also generated by Crux as Java packages.
